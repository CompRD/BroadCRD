# BroadCRD

Open source version of code developed at David Jaffe's Computational
R and D Group at the Broad Institute.

Please note that this is the migration of a private subversion
repository into the public space.  Previously we had released software,
in an open-source manner, but as packages that were each a subset of the
code here.  This is pretty much everything, **including code that was
``one-off'' for a specifc purpose, code that does not work correctly,
and everything else, warts and all**.  

Please consult the 
[blog and website](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/) for
information about the Discovar, Discovar De Novo, and ALLPATHS-LG
packages.  Other executables, not distributed specifically with these
programs, may not work as intended.  Indeed, as the LICENSE.txt
stipulates, it's entirely possible that nothing works as intended, but
we hope that's not the case.

Please consult the online [help
page](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/?page_id=19)
for pointers about how to get assistance with this software.

Assemble on!
