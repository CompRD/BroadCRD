# BroadCRD

Open source version of code initially developed by the Computational
R&D group at the Broad Institute, and mostly focused on genome assembly.

Please note that this is the migration of a private subversion
repository into the public space.  Previously we had released software,
in an open-source manner, but as packages that were each a subset of the
code here.  This is pretty much everything, **including code that was
``one-off'' for a specific purpose, code that does not work correctly,
and everything else, warts and all**.  (Some older code, including most of 
ARACHNE, has been deleted from the repository to reduce its size.)

Please consult the 
[discovar blog and website](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/)
and [allpaths-lg blog and website](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/allpaths-lg/blog/)
for information about the packages.  Other executables, not distributed 
specifically with these
programs, may not work as intended.  Indeed, as the LICENSE.txt
stipulates, it's entirely possible that nothing works as intended, but
we hope that's not the case.

Please consult the online [help
page](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/?page_id=19)
for pointers about how to get assistance with this software.

Assemble on!
