This file explains the format of the Synteny files generated by the
assisted assembly.


BASICS

Def. 1. Refererence, or target, is the reference genome used in the assisted
assembly (the WGS reads in input have been aligned to it).

Def. 2. An anchoring read is a read for which at least one alignment against
the reference has been found (some reads may fail to align  anywhere on the
reference).

Def. 3. An anchoring is unique if the read aligns uniquely on the reference
genome.

Def. 4. The two end reads from the same insert form a valid anchoring pair
if the two reads align uniquely on the reference genome, and orientation
and distance between them is consistent with the expected insert size/stdev.


WHAT IS SYNTENY

Def. 5. Select (and fix) a subset S(r) of the set of all anchoring reads. 
Select and fix a given assembly A of the project. For every superconting
super in A consider the mappings of the supercontig implied by all the
reads in super that belong to S(r). If such mappings agree with each other,
then super is said to "map unambiguously" to the reference.

There are various types of Synteny, based on which S(r) is chosen to 
start with:

1. "strict": S(r) consists only of valid anchoring pairs;

2. "unique: S(r) consists of all unique anchorings;

3. "all": S(r) consists of all anchoring reads.


SYNTENY FORMAT

Anchoring information is provided on a super by super basis. For each
super all the mapping events are listed, clustered in self-consistent
chunks.  An example of a mapping event:

  q_12_rc t_32 @[3107727 3125361) q@2137_17634 t@3109864 r_5625924

q_12_rc: supercontig id 12 is mapped rc on the reference

t_32: reference id is 32

@[3107727 3125361): mapping on reference 32 of super 12

q@2137_17634: the anchoring read start at base 2137 of super 12, which is
 17634 bases long

t@3109864: the alignment of the anchoring read starts at base 3109864 on
 the reference

r_5625924: this is the id of the anchoring read.


NOTES

You need a file that maps reference id to chromosome name, and a similar
file that maps read id to read name.
