DISCOVAR de novo installation
=============================


Requirements
------------

64 bit x86_64 based linux distribution

GCC 4.7 or above

jemalloc 3.6.0 or above

samtools (required if using bam files)


Building
--------

Ensure that GCC and jemalloc are built and installed on your system.

Download the latest version of DISCOVAR de novo from the FTP site.

Extract the contents of the downloaded file:

    tar xzf discovardenovo-NNNNN.tar.gz

Move into the unpacked directory:

    cd discovardenovo-NNNNN

Execute the configuration script:

    ./configure

This assumes that you can copy executables to /usr/local/bin.  If you cannot, you should instead execute:
    ./configure --prefix=<install-root-dir>
For example:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

Build the software:

    make all

Install the software:

    make install


The executables will be in /usr/local/bin, or in the location you provided with the prefix option. We recommend you add the executables directory to your path.


Troubleshooting
---------------

The 'configure' script supports numerous options that allow control of which functionality is enabled. To see these options use:

    ./configure --help

DISCOVAR de novo requires jemalloc to be built and installed. The configuration script will try to find the appropriate library, but if it fails you can specify the location using:

    ./configure --with-jemalloc=<jemalloc-lib-dir>

e.g. 

    ./configure --with-jemalloc=/usr/local/jemalloc/lib
