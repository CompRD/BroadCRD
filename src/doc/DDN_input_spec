SPECIFICATION OF INPUT DATA TO DISCOVAR DE NOVO

The formal specification is given in detail below.  If this is too much for
a first reading, skip down the the EXAMPLES section!

Input reads are specified using
READS="rg1 + ... + rgn"
where each rgi is a "read group" (see below).  Alternatively the syntax
READS=@fn
may be used, where fn is a file having lines
rg1
rg2
...
rgn

Blanks in the READS specification are allowed for clarity and are removed at 
the start of processing.

====================================================================================

READ GROUP SYNTAX

Each individual read group has the form

arg1:value1, arg2:value2, ..., argn:valuen :: data

or simply

data

where data is described below and the allowed arg:value fields are:
* type:t, where t is frag or long or jump (but only frag allowed now); default frag
* sample:s, where s is the sample name; default C
* lib:l, where l is the library name (currently unused); default 1
* frac:c, where f is the decimal fraction of the data to be used; default 1.

We recommend that the sample be a short string, as this makes it easier to 
interactively examine the assembly graph.

====================================================================================

DATA SYNTAX

The data field is a comma-separated list of file specifiers (see below).
Each file specifier is expanded by globbing, and this globbing will expand
expressions of the form {x1,...,xn}, a "csh extension".  You can probably find 
the details of the standard globbing rules using "man 7 glob".

The expanded list must consist of files having one of the following formats:
* a bam file, with extension .bam
* a fastq file, with extension .fastq or .fq (or .fastq.gz or .fq.gz if compressed)
* a fastb file, with extension .fastb.

The x.fastb format is internal, and if used, there must be a parallel x.qualb
or x.qualp file.

Handling of fastq files for type frag and jump.  If two files are within the same 
read group and start with the same read name, they will be treated as paired. 
Otherwise the file will be treated as interlaced: read pairs appear as consecutive
entries.  (Technical note: the read name is computed as the text after the
initial @, and before the first blank, slash or newline.)

====================================================================================

EXAMPLES

1. READS="x.bam"

Use the reads in the file x.bam.  These are treated as type frag.

2. READS="woof/*.fastq"

where the directory woof contains pairs of non-interlaced fastq files, to be
treated as type frag.  Find them all and pair them as described above.

3. READS="sample:T :: t.bam   +   sample:N :: n.bam"

this specifies data for a sample T (perhaps tumor) and a sample N (perhaps normal).
