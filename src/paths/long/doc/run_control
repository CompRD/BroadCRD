Notes on running only part of LongProto:

1. Generate just a genome fastb file and exit: supply the
   'CONTROL OVER REGION' arguments and OUT_GENOME=..., EXIT=OUT_GENOME.

2. Generate just simulated reads: run with OUT_SIM_READS=... EXIT=OUT_SIM_READS.

3. Load Illumina reads from Picard and error correct using the ALLPATHS-LG
   pipeline: specify READS=#picard and supply TMP directory.
