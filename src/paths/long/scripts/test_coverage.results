Results of test_coverage, run with r45637.

Below there is some data regarding the affect of coverage and density on 
whole-genome assembly results, assuming 250 base reads from the HiSeq 2500, 
from a PCR-free library.  This is based on data from 2.5 flowcells.  If there 
is more NA12878 data we could repeat the analysis.  The same analysis could 
also be used to assess the effect of other lab conditions on results.

Briefly, there are two conclusions:
(1) there is a big difference between one lane and two lanes;
(2) for the data we have, given two lanes of data, better results are 
    obtained using higher density lanes.

====================================================================================

For 91 'finished' Fosmids from NA12878, and for various combinations of lanes of 
250 base PCR-free HiSeq 2500 data from NA12878, we assembled the regions 
corresponding to the Fosmids and computed the number of error events and gaps of 
the assemblies, relative to the finished sequence.
