This can be 

bacteria: bcereus, bifi, ecoli, ecoli11, ecoli12, ecoli_scs, entero, rhody, neiss, 
scardovia, tb, tb148

human: human, hpool1, hpool2, hpool3, human.hpool2, human.hpool3

other: mouse, plasmo, arabidopsis, ***.fastb, unknown or random:spec, 
where spec is a string specifying a 'structured' random genome, as in the following 
example: "A(10K)|B(100)|A'|A|C(100K)|,A|A" -- this would be for two chromosomes, 
where the first involves random regions A,B,C of specified sizes, and is the 
concatenation A|B|A'|A|C| where A' denotes the rc of A and the last | indicates 
circularity of the chromosome.  The second chromosome is the linear concatenation of
two copies of A.
