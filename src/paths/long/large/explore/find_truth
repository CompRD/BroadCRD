Here's a way to find an approximation to the truth for a hard region in NA12878,
and the reads that might go there:

1. Let's say you have a gap between two edges in an NA12878 assembly and you want to 
   know what's in the middle.

2. Run SearchPB (possibly de-hardcoding first) to find some NA12878 PacBio reads that
   bridge the gap.  This is terribly inefficient.  Of course we could align all 
   the PacBio reads to the reference sequence (or even to hg19, grch38 and 
   PB-Chin-CHM1).

3. Now align the reads to the reference sequences.  One reference sequence might
   give a better alignment.  Had this happen with PB-Chin-CHM1.

4. Find perfect stretches in these alignments.  These sequences are presumably
   true sequences present in NA12878.

5. Now run SearchFastb on your favorite read set to fetch reads that match these
   true sequences. (terribly inefficient)
