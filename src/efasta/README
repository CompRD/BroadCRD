Extended fasta format.

Prolog.  Here we define a DRAFT 'extended fasta format' which extends fasta 
nucleic acid format (Pearson) by allowing choices.  For example,
AAA{C,CC}TTT
represents either AAACTTT or AAACCTTT.
To avoid mixing two systems, we do not allow fasta ambiguity codes 
(e.g. S = C or G).

Definition.  A file in extended fasta format (*.efasta) consists of one or
more lines of the form

>[name1][comments1]
[bases1.1]
...
[bases1.n1]
>[name2][comments2]
...
[bases2.1]
...
[bases2.n2]
...

where 

* [namei] is a nonempty string from the alphabet of "printable white-space-free
characters", ASCII codes 33-126 (in decimal notation)

* [commentsi] is any string of printable characters (33-126 or blank or tab),
that is either empty or starts with a blank or tab

* ni >= 0

* ni >= 1 and each [basesi.j] is a nonempty string

* [basesi] is defined to be the concatenation of [basesi.1]...[basesi.ni], after
removal of the trailing newline for each

* [basesi] must then be a string from the character set "ACGTN{,}", 
which is a concatenation of atoms A, C, G, T, N, and "choose" expressions 
{x1,...,xn}, where n >= 2, and x1,...,xn are distinct strings from the 
alphabet ACGT.  It is allowed for one of the xi to be empty.

Semantically, each "choose" expression "{x1,...,xn} is treated as 
"either x1 or x2 or ... or xn", and each sequence of one or more Ns is treated 
as a gap of that approximate size.

Note that lower-case nucleotides acgtn are not allowed.

Formally there is no restriction on line length however lines of 80 or less
characters are customary, and extremely long lines will tend to break people's 
code.

Examples.

[1] GGGGAT{C,}
    denotes either GGGGATC or GGGGAT

[2] AAA{C,G}TTT{C,G}AAA
    denotes either AAACTTTCAAA or AAACTTTGAAA or AAAGTTTCAAA or AAAGTTTGAAA

Note.  One could argue that this format should be called "extended fasta 
nucleic acid" and that files of it should have suffix .efna.
