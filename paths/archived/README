This subdirectory holds code that's being shelved at least temporarily,
and possibly permanently, probably because the experiment was a failure,
but that we feel we shouldn't just delete, since it might prove useful
for later development.

Any main() here should contain the exact line

// MakeDepend: archived

so that it does not get routinely compiled.
