I built boost_1_55_0 and lachesis with gnu C++ version 4.7.2.

You can see my envionment for building lachesis in the script build.sh.  Note that I pointed to boost/include for my boost dir.
I had to dink with the main lachesis makefile to get the lachesis main program to compile -- it needed the boost include.
I also had to dink with the boost build by adding a soft link to the include subdir like this:
ln -s .. stage
Josh appears to have assumed an older default boost layout.

I'm using BWA 0.7.4
I'm using samtools 0.1.19
I'm using bedtools 2.16.2
I'm using R 3.0
I'm using perl 5.10.1
Restriction site is GATC (for MboI).

I've added Lachesis's home dir to my PATH and the boost libs to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

Here's a sketch of the process I followed:

#!/bin/csh
use .bwa-0.7.4
use .samtools-0.1.19
use .bedtools-version-2.16.2
use R-3.0
setenv PATH /wga/dev/local/shendurelab-LACHESIS-2151de9:$PATH
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /wga/dev/local/boost/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

bwa index -a bwtsw contigs.fasta
bwa aln -t48 contigs.fasta HIC117_R1.fastq > R1.sai
bwa aln -t48 contigs.fasta HIC117_R2.fastq > R2.sai
bwa samse contigs.fasta R1.sai HIC117_R1.fastq > R1.sam
bwa samse contigs.fasta R2.sai HIC117_R2.fastq > R2.sam
CombineSAMs R1.sam R2.sam > combined.sam
samtools view -Sb combined.sam > combined.bam
#(edit PreprocessSAMs.pl so it knows where samtools and bedtools live)
PreprocessSAMs.pl combined.bam contigs.fasta
Lachesis lachesis.ini


Here's my lachesis.ini:
SPECIES = other
OUTPUT_DIR = lachesisout
DRAFT_ASSEMBLY_FASTA = contigs.fasta
SAM_DIR = .
SAM_FILES = combined.REduced.paired_only.bam
RE_SITE_SEQ = GATC
USE_REFERENCE = 0
SIM_BIN_SIZE = 0
REF_ASSEMBLY_FASTA = noref.fa
BLAST_FILE_HEAD = none
(remainder of lachesis.ini, starting with "WHICH ALGORITHMIC STEPS" section, unaltered)
