CrossOut Manual
===============

CrossOut is an auxiliary program that may be used to remove cross-contamination from DISCOVAR de novo assemblies in cases where samples have been prepared in parallel and in close proximity in the lab.


Introduction
============

In certain situations when many samples are being prepared and sequenced together, cross contamination can occur. This tool will attempt to remove edegs from DISCOVAR de novo assemblies that are due to cross contamination, without harming real genomic sequence. You must generate a DISCOVAR de novo assembly for each sample in turn, then run this tool on the complete set.

Note that this tool does not remove contamination from any other source. Do not run it on a single assembly, or on a set of completely unrelated assemblies.


Input files
===========

CrossOut takes as input a set of assemblies, each one generated by DISCOVAR de novo. Supply the parent directory containing the assembly directories for your samples. For example, if you ran:

    DiscovarDeNovo READS=sample1.bam OUT_DIR=/myassemblies/sample1
    DiscovarDeNovo READS=sample2.bam OUT_DIR=/myassemblies/sample2

then use:

    CrossOut DIR=/myassemblies


Output files
============

New assembly files are created for each sample in the subdirectory:

    a.clean
